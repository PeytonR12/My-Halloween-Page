        <h3>McCune Mansion</h3>
    <img src="images/McCone Mansion.jpg">
    <p>McCune Mansion in Salt Lake City features 21 rooms and dates back to 1901. The McCunes donated the historic home to the Mormon Church for a school of music in 1920. Then, in 1953, it became Brigham Young University's Salt Lake City Center. Now, this place is used for tours and parties, hosting weddings and all sorts of celebrations.
        Here's where it gets interesting: There are some ghostly characters who like to hang out in the mansion. There are two men, one in a mysterious black cape, and a young girl around ten years old. The little girl seems to love the weddings. You know she's a former resident because there's a picture of her hanging on the mansion walls. At weddings, 
        she's the life of the ghostly party, dancing and giggling the night away. As for our cape-wearing friend, he's more of a Christmas enthusiast. Spooky, right?</p>

        <h3>The Rio Grande Depot</h3>
        <img src="images/The Rio Grande Depot.jpg">
        <p>The Rio Grande Depot in Salt Lake City is a great place for ghost hunters searching for the paranormal. There are many reports of ghostly encounters, like shadowy figures approaching security guards only to suddenly disappear and late-night footsteps on the mezzanine. The ghost most encountered is “the Purple Lady.” The story goes that her fiance decided to end things and threw the engagement ring onto the tracks.
         She met her untimely end when a train hit her while she was chasing the engagement ring. Now, she's a regular visitor at the depot, often hanging out in the ladies' restrooms.</p>
